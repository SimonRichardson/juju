In software design, a **controller** is an architectural component responsible for managing the flow of data and interactions within a system, and for mediating between different parts of the system. In Juju, it is defined in the same way, with the mention that:

- It is set up via the boostrap process.
- It refers to the initial controller {ref}`unit <unit>` as well as any units added later on (for machine clouds, for the purpose of {ref}`high-availability <high-availability>`) -- each of which includes
    - a {ref}`unit agent <unit-agent>`,
    - [`juju-controller`](https://charmhub.io/juju-controller) charm code, and
    - a {ref}`controller agent <controller-agent>` running, among other things, the Juju API server and an in-process embedded [Dqlite](https://canonical.com/dqlite) database. <p>
- It is responsible for implementing all the changes defined by a Juju {ref}`user <user>` via a Juju client post-bootstrap.
- It stores state in the internal Dqlite database.

## Controller storage

A Juju controller has two basic persistent storage needs: database access and blob storage.

Prior to Juju 4, both these needs were satisfied by a MongoDB database; however, with the switch to a Dqlite database in Juju 4, only the database access need is satisfied -- for blob storage the Juju controller will require an external object store.

By default, Juju will store blobs on the filesystem of the controllerâ€™s supporting infrastructure. However, either during bootstrap or later, you can (and, in a production-setting, should!) specify any S3-compatible object store you want (e.g., AWS S3, MicroCeph, MinIO, etc.) using the object-store-related controller configuration keys ({ref}`controller-config-object-store-type`, {ref}`controller-config-object-store-s3-endpoint`, {ref}`controller-config-object-store-s3-static-key`, {ref}`controller-config-object-store-s3-static-secret`, {ref}`controller-config-object-store-s3-static-session`).

Also, Juju will apply default S3 policy permissions, but you are free to change them, so long as they satisfy the following as a minimum (at least, during model creation):

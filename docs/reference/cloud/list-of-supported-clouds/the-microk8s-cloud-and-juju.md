# The MicroK8s cloud and Juju

This document describes details specific to using your a MicroK8s cloud with Juju.

```{ibnote}
See more: [Getting started on Microk8s](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started)
```

When using this cloud with Juju, it is important to keep in mind that it is a (1) Kubernetes cloud and (2) not some other cloud.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`cloud-differences`
```

As the differences related to (1) are already documented generically in the rest of the docs, here we record just those that follow from (2).


## Requirements

# Machine

```{ibnote}
See also: {ref}`manage-machines`
```

In Juju, a **machine** is a {ref}`compute resource <resource-compute>` requested implicitly (e.g., through {ref}`command-juju-deploy`, {ref}`command-juju-add-unit`, etc.) or explicitly (e.g., through {ref}`command-juju-add-machine`) from a machine {ref}`cloud <cloud>`.

```{important}

This definition suggests that, regardless of whether the cloud is a bare metal cloud, a virtual machine cloud, or a LXD container- or VM-based cloud, and regardless of whether the command targets a regular instance or rather a LXD container on a regular instance (all the commands above can apply to both), what's being provisioned is always, from the point of view of Juju, a 'machine'.

From the point of view of an end user, this is absolutely true, with one small caveat -- even though listed in `juju` outputs under 'Machines', and in general handled via the same CLI commands as a machine, a LXD container provisioned on top of a regular cloud instance will be named after its host machine; e.g., `0/lxd/5` = LXD container `5` on machine `0`.

```

(machines-and-units)=
## Machines and units

When you deploy an {ref}`application <application>` on a machine, there is usually one {ref}`unit <unit>` per machine. However, it is usually possible to optimise resources by deploying multiple units of the same or of different applications to the same machine.

(machines-and-system-containers)=
## Machines and system (LXD) containers

In Juju, they are both essentially the same -- 'machines'.  For example, most `juju` CLI commands that target machines can actually target system containers in the exact same way.


````{dropdown} Example

E.g., `juju add-machine lxd` starts a LXD container on a new machine and adds *both* as 'machines' -- the only difference being that the container 'machine' is prefixed with the ID of its host machine and the annotation `lxd`:

```text
$ juju add-machine lxd
created container 1/lxd/0

$ juju machines
Machine  State    Address         Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
0        started  10.154.118.110  juju-dadfb7-0  ubuntu@22.04      Running
1        pending                  pending        ubuntu@22.04      Creating container
1/lxd/0  pending                  pending        ubuntu@22.04
```

And if you then deploy an application to a LXD container (without specifying any particular container), that will again provision two machines:

```text
$ juju deploy postgresql --to lxd
Located charm "postgresql" in charm-hub, revision 288
Deploying "postgresql" from charm-hub charm "postgresql", revision 288 in channel 14/stable on ubuntu@22.04/stable
ubuntu@charm-dev:~/.local/share/juju$ juju machines
Machine  State    Address         Inst id              Base          AZ  Message
0        started  10.154.118.110  juju-dadfb7-0        ubuntu@22.04      Running
1        started  10.154.118.72   juju-dadfb7-1        ubuntu@22.04      Running

2        started  10.154.118.209  juju-dadfb7-2        ubuntu@22.04      Running
2/lxd/0  pending                  pending              ubuntu@22.04      acquiring LXD image
```

(machine-designations)=
## Machine designations

In Juju, many different commands have a machine argument. The shape of this argument depends on whether the machine is existing vs. new and a regular cloud instance vs. a LXD container on top of a regular cloud instance. The argument can also contain combinations, in comma-separated format. The examples below illustrate all the various cases:

| shape of the machine argument | meaning|
|-|-|
|  | a new machine |
|`0`| machine 0 |
|`0,4`| machines 0 and 4|
| `lxd` | a new LXD container  on a new machine |
| `lxd:25`| a new LXD container on machine 25|
| `0/lxd/4`| LXD container `4` on machine `0`|
|`3,0/lxd/2,lxd:5`| machine 3, LXD container 2 on machine 0, and a new LXD container on machine 5|

(machine-customisation)=
## Machine customisation
A machine's specific hardware can be customised via {ref}`constraints <constraint>`.

(machine-base)=
## Machine base

```{versionadded} 3.1.0
```

In Juju, a **base** is  a way to identify a particular operating system (OS) image for a Juju {ref}`machine <machine>`.

This can be done via the name of the OS followed by the `@` symbol and the channel of the OS that you want to target, specified in terms of `<track>` or, optionally, `<track>/<risk>`. For example, `ubuntu@22.04` or `ubuntu@22.04/stable`.

A 'base' replaces the older notion of 'series'.

<!--If we link to the doc on Channel https://juju.is/docs/sdk/channel , we need to specify that the notion of `branch` is not relevant here. -->

```

The procedure for how to add a cloud credential to Juju depends on whether the cloud is a machine (traditional, non-Kubernetes) cloud or rather a Kubernetes cloud.

### Add a credential for a machine cloud

In general, if your cloud is a local LXD cloud and if you have controller {ref}`user-access-controller-superuser` access: Your cloud credential is set up and retrieved automatically for you, so you can skip this step; run `juju credentials` to confirm. (If you only have {ref}`user-access-cloud-add-model` access, you might still be able to make this happen automatically by running `juju autoload-credentials`.)

Otherwise, to add a machine cloud credential to Juju:

1. Choose a cloud authentication type and collect the information required for that type from your cloud account. The authentication types and the information needed for each type depend on your chosen cloud. Run `juju show-cloud` or consult {ref}`the cloud reference doc <list-of-supported-machine-clouds>` to find out.

1. Provide this information to Juju. You may do so in three ways -- interactively, by specifying a YAML file, or automatically, by having Juju check your local YAML files or environment variables. In general, we recommend the interactive method. (The latter two are both error-prone, and the last one is not available for all clouds.)

    a. To add a credential interactively, run the `add-credential` command followed by the name of your machine cloud. For example:

    ```text
    juju add-credential aws
    ```

    This will start an interactive session where youâ€™ll be asked to choose a cloud region (if applicable), specify a credential name (you can pick any name you want), and then provide the credential information (e.g., access key, etc.)

    The command also  offers various flags that you can use  to provide all this information in one go (e.g., the path to a YAML file containing the credential definition) as an alternative to the interactive session.

    ```{ibnote}
    See more: {ref}`command-juju-add-credential`
    ```

    b. To add a credential by specifying a YAML file, use your credential information to prepare a `credentials.yaml` file, then run the `add-credential` command with the `-f` flag followed by the path to this file.

    ```{ibnote}
    See more: {ref}`command-juju-add-credential`
    ```

    c. To add a credential automatically, use your credential information to prepare a `credentials.yaml` file / environment variables, then run the `autoload-credentials` command:

    ```text
    juju autoload-credentials
    ```

    Juju will scan your local credentials files / environment variables / rc files and, if it detects something suitable for the present cloud, it will display a prompt asking you to confirm the addition of the credential and to specify a name for it.

    The command also allows you to restrict the search to a specific cloud, a specific controller, etc.

    ```{ibnote}
    See more: {ref}`command-juju-autoload-credentials`
    ```

### Add a credential for a Kubernetes cloud

For a Kubernetes cloud, credential definitions are added automatically when you add the cloud definition to Juju. Run `juju credentials` to verify.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`add-a-kubernetes-cloud`
```

## View all the known credentials

To see a list of all the known credentials, run the `credentials` command:

```text
juju credentials
```

This should output something similar to this:

```text
Controller Credentials:
Cloud           Credentials
lxd             localhost*

Client Credentials:
Cloud   Credentials
aws     bob*, carol
google  wayne
```

where the asterisk denotes the default credential for a given cloud.

By passing various flags, you can also choose to view just the credentials known to the client, or just those for a particular controller; you can select a different output format or an output file (and also choose to include secrets); etc.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-credentials`
```

## View details about a credential

You can view details about all your credentials at once or just about a specific credential.

**All credentials.** To view details about all your credentials at once, run the `show-credential` command with no argument:

```text
juju show-credential
```

By passing various flags you can filter by controller, select an output format or an output file, etc.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-show-credential`
```

**A specific credential.** To view details about just one specific credential, run the `show-credential` command followed by the name of the cloud and the name of the credential. For example:

```text
juju show-credential mycloud mycredential
```

By passing various flags you can specify an output format or an output file, display secret attributes, etc.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-show-credential`
```

## Set or get the default credential

**Set.** To set the default credential for a cloud on the current client, run the `default-credential` command followed by the name of the cloud and the name of the credential. For example:

```text
juju default-credential aws carol
```

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-default-credential`
```

**Get.** To view the currrently set default credential for a cloud, run the `default-credential` command followed by the name of the cloud. For example:

```text
juju default-credential aws
```
This should display the default credential.

<!--
By running the same with the `--reset` flag  you can reset the default.
-->

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-default-credential`
```


## Add a credential to a model

```{caution}
You can only do this if you are a controller admin or a model owner.
```

If you have controller {ref}`user-access-controller-superuser` or model {ref}`user-access-model-admin` access, to add a controller credential to a model, run the `set-credential` command followed by a flag for the intended model, the host cloud, and the name of the credential. For example:

```text
juju set-credential -m trinity aws bob
```

If the credential is only known to the client, this will first upload it to the controller and then relate it to the model. (If the credential is already attached to another model, this will cause it to be connected to two models.)

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-set-credential`
```

## Update a credential

To update a credential, run the `update-credential` command followed by the name of the cloud and the name of the credential. For example:

```text
juju update-credential mycloud mycredential
```

This will start an interactive session where you will be asked to specify various parameters for the update.

By passing various flags, you can also perform this operation in-line. And by dropping the credential (and the cloud) argument and passing a flag with a credential YAML file, you can also update all your credentials at once.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-update-credential`
```


## Remove a credential

To remove a credential, run the `remove-credential` command followed by the name of the cloud and the name of the credential. For example:

```text
juju remove-credential mycloud mycredential
```

This will start an interactive session where you will be asked to choose whether to apply this operation for the client or a specific controller or both. You can bypass this by using the client and controller flags in-line.

```{ibnote}
See more: {ref}`command-juju-remove-credential`
```
